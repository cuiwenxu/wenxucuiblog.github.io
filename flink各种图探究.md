During job execution, the JobManager keeps track of distributed tasks, decides when to schedule the next task (or set of tasks), and reacts to finished tasks or execution failures.

The JobManager receives the JobGraph, which is a representation of the data flow consisting of operators (JobVertex) and intermediate results (IntermediateDataSet). Each operator has properties, like the parallelism and the code that it executes. In addition, the JobGraph has a set of attached libraries, that are necessary to execute the code of the operators.

The JobManager transforms the JobGraph into an ExecutionGraph. The ExecutionGraph is a parallel version of the JobGraph: For each JobVertex, it contains an ExecutionVertex per parallel subtask. An operator with a parallelism of 100 will have one JobVertex and 100 ExecutionVertices. The ExecutionVertex tracks the state of execution of a particular subtask. All ExecutionVertices from one JobVertex are held in an ExecutionJobVertex, which tracks the status of the operator as a whole. Besides the vertices, the ExecutionGraph also contains the IntermediateResult and the IntermediateResultPartition. The former tracks the state of the IntermediateDataSet, the latter the state of each of its partitions.
