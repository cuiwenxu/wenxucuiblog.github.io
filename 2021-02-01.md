# 配置总内存
Flink应用占用的内存可以分为两部分
- Flink进程占用的内存
- 运行Flink程序的jvm占用的内存

在Flink中设置内存的最简单方法是配置以下两个选项之一：

Component     |  Option for TaskManager  |  Option for JobManager 
-------- | ----- | -----
Total Flink memory  | taskmanager.memory.flink.size |  jobmanager.memory.flink.size
Total process memory  | taskmanager.memory.process.size | jobmanager.memory.process.size


>注：对于部署在本地的应用，更详细的配置请参照[TaskManager](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/deployment/memory/mem_setup_tm.html#local-execution)和[JobManager](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/deployment/memory/mem_setup_jobmanager.html#local-execution)进行配置。

The rest of the memory components will be adjusted automatically, based on default values or additionally configured options. See also how to set up other components for TaskManager and JobManager memory.
配置好了Total Flink memory和Total process memory的内存后，其他组件的内存会自动调整，

Configuring total Flink memory is better suited for standalone deployments where you want to declare how much memory is given to Flink itself. The total Flink memory splits up into JVM Heap and Off-heap memory. See also how to configure memory for standalone deployments.

If you configure total process memory you declare how much memory in total should be assigned to the Flink JVM process. For the containerized deployments it corresponds to the size of the requested container, see also how to configure memory for containers (Kubernetes, Yarn or Mesos).

Another way to set up the memory is to configure the required internal components of the total Flink memory which are specific to the concrete Flink process. Check how to configure them for TaskManager and for JobManager.

Note One of the three mentioned ways has to be used to configure Flink’s memory (except for local execution), or the Flink startup will fail. This means that one of the following option subsets, which do not have default values, have to be configured explicitly:
